  I asked copilot to generate column cleaning function i then modified small parts of it like line 62 and 50 i did this because i wanted to make it more simple. I asked copilot to handle the missing data and then I changed line 105,106,111, and 112. I changed these lines because it was guessing the prices and I wanted to change the missing price with zero instead of the median like it was doing before. I changed line 112 because I wanted the rows that were missing quantity to be dropped instead of being filled with zero. I simplified the clean column name function and also the handle missing values function because it was trying to guess values instead of just dropping them and if they are being guessed it would make them inaccurate. Lastly I cleaned up all the code and put in my own comments and made sure it ran. What I learned about copilot is that it is a helpful tool to have but you still have to go back and double check that all the code makes sense logically and that it doesn't make assumptions.
